This project analyzes customer reviews of the iPhone 14 to uncover user sentiment and identify
major themes in customer feedback. Using a Kaggle dataset that contains reviews from different
regions and platforms, we applied a combined approach of LDA topic modeling and VADER sentiment
analysis to extract meaningful insights for product development and marketing strategy.

After preprocessing the data by removing non-English and low-information reviews, we conducted
LDA topic modeling and identified four key themes: camera performance, battery performance,
iPhone brand perception, and delivery service. We then integrated sentiment scores with topic
results to understand how customers feel about each area. The analysis shows that most camera-
related and brand-related reviews are positive, while battery performance and delivery issues
receive comparatively more negative sentiment.

Our findings highlight clear improvement opportunities for Apple, particularly in battery
lifespan, delivery reliability, and camera stability. Although the dataset contains limitations—
such as selection bias, limited demographic information, and many short/emoji-only reviews—
the combined LDA and VADER approach still reveals valuable customer insights. These insights
can support Apple and retailers in enhancing user experience, strengthening customer satisfaction,
and guiding future product innovations.
